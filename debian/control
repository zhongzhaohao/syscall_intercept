Description: System call intercepting library
 The system call intercepting library provides a low-level interface
 for hooking Linux system calls in user space. This is achieved
 by hotpatching the machine code of the standard C library in the
 memory of a process. The user of this library can provide the
 functionality of almost any syscall in user space, using the very
 simple API specified in the libsyscall_intercept_hook_point.h header file.
